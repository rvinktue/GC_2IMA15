In the GeometricChallenge folder you will find python code we use to solve the intersection problem.
The line segment intersections will be found by the LineSegmentIntersection.py main() function
This method will not only output all intersection to a file, but will also output a solution for the number of colors needed.

In the VertexColouring folder you will find c++ code we use to solve the vertex colouring problem.
The intersection in the output file will then be loaded into C++ to further try and find a better solution using vertex colouring
